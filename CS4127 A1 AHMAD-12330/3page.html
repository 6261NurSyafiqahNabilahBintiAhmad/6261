                <h3>Japanese Cuisine</h3>
                <p>Japanese cuisine is world-famous for its delicate flavors, beautiful presentation, and attention to detail. One of the most iconic dishes is sushi, which consists of vinegared rice paired with various types of fish, seafood, or vegetables. Sushi is enjoyed in various forms such as nigiri, where fish is placed over a mound of rice, and maki, where ingredients are rolled in rice and seaweed.</p>
                <p>Ramen is another beloved dish, a hearty noodle soup typically served with a rich broth made from pork, chicken, or miso. The dish is accompanied by noodles, vegetables, and sometimes a boiled egg or slices of pork. The variations of ramen depend on the region, making it a versatile and widely loved meal across the country.</p>
                <p>Tempura, a dish where seafood and vegetables are lightly battered and deep-fried, is another popular choice. The crispy texture and the delicate flavors of tempura make it a favorite, often served with a dipping sauce. Another must-try street food is takoyaki, savory dough balls filled with octopus and often topped with bonito flakes, pickled ginger, and a savory sauce.</p>
                <p>For dessert, matcha, a finely ground green tea powder, is used in many sweet treats like cakes, cookies, and drinks. Matcha has a distinctive slightly bitter taste that pairs perfectly with the sweetness of Japanese desserts.</p>
